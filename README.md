**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, 

As someone who is generally health conscious, I wanted to create an easy-to-access hub to display nutritional information about different ingredients and food items in fastfood restaurants. Nutrition facts are generated from the Edamam Food API where you can see approximate values for vitamins, protein and more.



## Optimizations
I would like to add the "Like" feature so that users can bookmark favorite ingredients or meals.


## Lessons Learned:
I got the chance to the the power of using a framework like Bootstrap to get an application up and running. Although there were a few challenges gathering and displaying the correct data from the API, I learned the importance of playing around with the code to solve a problem.
